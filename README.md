# OpenHT Application

This repository contains a Zephyr example application. The main purpose of this
repository is to serve as a reference on how to structure Zephyr based
applications. Some of the features demonstrated in this example are:

- Basic [Zephyr application][app_dev] skeleton
- [Zephyr workspace applications][workspace_app]
- [West T2 topology][west_t2]
- [Custom boards][board_porting]
- Custom [devicetree bindings][bindings]
- Out-of-tree [drivers][drivers]
- Out-of-tree libraries
- Example CI configuration (using Github Actions)
- Custom [west extension][west_ext]

This repository is versioned together with the [Zephyr main tree][zephyr]. This
means that every time that Zephyr is tagged, this repository is tagged as well
with the same version number, and the [manifest](west.yml) entry for `zephyr`
will point to the corresponding Zephyr tag. For example, `example-application`
v2.6.0 will point to Zephyr v2.6.0. Note that the `main` branch will always
point to the development branch of Zephyr, also `main`.

## Getting Started

Before getting started, make sure you have a proper Zephyr development
environment. You can follow the official
[Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html).

### Initialization

The first step is to initialize the workspace folder (``openht-workspace``) where
the ``openht-firmware`` and all Zephyr modules will be cloned. You can do
that by running:

```shell
# initialize openht-workspace for the openht_firmware (main branch)
west init -m https://github.com/M17-Project/OpenHT-firmware.git --mr main openht-workspace
# update Zephyr modules
cd openht-workspace
west update
```

### Build & Run

The application can be built for the STM32F469 Discovery board by running:

```shell
cd openht-firmware
west build -b stm32f469i_disco app
```

Once you have built the application you can flash it by running:

```shell
west flash
```
